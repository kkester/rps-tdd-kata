## TDD Code Kata Starter Project

This branch contains an example of one of the possible end state solutions.  In this solution, SOLID principles such os SRP and OCP were not in scope and would need to be covered in subsequent exercises. The `RpsTest` class contains all test scenarios and the `Rps` class contains a simple solution that has had some minor refactoring work done.
